```{r}
library(readr)
library(data.table)
```


I choose a smaller dataset to work with so I could easily read and interpret the file. Once I apply my findings, this code can be used for other bridge data sets by simply changing the link in the read.csv command.


I intially started reading in the data with the read.csv, read_csv, and fread commands. All three of these commands produced 24 obs. of 123 variables. 

```{r}
bridges. = read.csv("https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/2019/delimited/VI19.txt")

bridges_ = read_csv("https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/2019/delimited/VI19.txt")

bridgesf = fread("https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/2019/delimited/VI19.txt")
```
